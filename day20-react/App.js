//used to contain data or information about the component. The state in a component can change over time. A component with the state is known as stateful components. It is the heart of the react component which determines the behavior of the component and how it will render. A state must be kept as simple as possible. It can be set by using the setState() method and calling setState() method triggers UI updates. To set an initial state before any interaction occurs, we need to use the getInitialState() method.To define a state, you have to first declare a default set of values for defining the component's initial state. To do this, add a class constructor which assigns an initial state using this.state. The 'this.state' property can be rendered inside render() method.

There are mainly two types of form input in React.

Uncontrolled component
Controlled component

Uncontrolled component

The uncontrolled input is similar to the traditional 
HTML form inputs. The DOM itself handles the form data.
 Here, the HTML elements maintain their own state that
  will be updated when the input value changes.
   To write an uncontrolled component, you need to use
    a ref to get form values from the DOM. In other words,
     there is no need to write an event handler for every
      state update. You can use a ref to 
access the input field value of the form from the DOM.

Controlled Component
In HTML, form elements typically maintain their
 own state and update it according to the user input.
  In the controlled component, the input form element
   is handled by the component rather than the DOM.
    Here, the mutable state is kept in the state property
 and will be updated only with setState() method.

 React Events
An event is an action that could be triggered as a 
result of the user action or system generated event. 
For example, a mouse click, loading of a web page, 
pressing a key, window resizes, and other interactions 
are called events.

React has its own event handling system which is very 
similar to handling events on DOM elements. 
The react event handling system is known as 
Synthetic Events. 
The synthetic event is a cross-browser wrapper 
of the browsers native event.

React EventsHandling events with react have some syntactic differences from handling events on DOM. These are:

1.React events are named as camelCase instead of lowercase.
2.With JSX, a function is passed as the event handler instead of a string. For example:

Event declaration in plain HTML:

<button onclick="showMessage()">  
       Hello JavaTpoint  
</button>  

Event declaration in React:

<button onClick={showMessage}>  
      Hello JavaTpoint  
</button>  

3. In react, we cannot return false to prevent the 
default behavior. We must call preventDefault 
event explicitly to prevent the default behavior.
